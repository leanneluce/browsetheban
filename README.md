# Browse the Ban

### What is this?
Browse the Ban is a protest piece in the form of a Chrome extension designed to make the Trump administration's recent ban on immigrants from seven predominantly-Muslim countries more tangible. The extension strikes out the name of every country banned as well as common names of people from those countries, and on hovering over the word replaces it with the hashtag #MuslimBan.

We believe that no one should be denied entry to the United States solely based on national origin or religion, and we hope that this project will help remind people of the tragic impact that this sudden immigration ban has on real people's lives.
