# Browse the Ban

### What is this?
Browse the Ban is an art piece created to protest the Trump administration's recent ban on immigrants from seven predominantly-Muslim countries. It's far too easy to make sweeping generalizations about entire populations that do a deep disservice to their underlying humanity. In order to make the impact of the executive order more tangible, the extension strikes out the name of every country banned as well as common names of people from those countries. By striking out the names of individuals in addition to the countries, we are reminded of the absurdity of such a broad ban and understand that the immigration ban is fundamentally about barring individuals in search of a better life. On hovering over the word the extension replaces the struck-out word with "Stop the #MuslimBan" to bring the user's attention back to a call for protest and action.

We believe that no one should be denied entry to the United States solely based on national origin or religion, and we hope that this project will help remind people of the tragic impact that this sudden immigration ban has on real people's lives.
